Init containers run before the application and are used for setup tasks like waiting for dependencies or running migrations. Sidecar containers run alongside the application for its entire lifecycle to provide supporting functionality such as logging, monitoring, or proxying. Both share the same Pod but serve very different purposes.
Sidecar real world example: logging monitoring proxying
Init example: • Run DB migrations • Verify secrets exist • Pull configs from Vault • Wait for Kafka / Redis
They are defined in pod level multiple container. They cannot exist as standalone system. In real lifr scenarioes these pods will be defined uder a deployment.
